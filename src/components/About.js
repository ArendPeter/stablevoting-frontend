            Our goal is to translate academic <RegLinkReact to="/research">research</RegLinkReact> on voting into a beneficial service for the public, as well as to improve our understanding of voting by the study of real elections.

            <Question>Why Stable Voting?</Question>
            <Paragraph>
              Stable Voting respects majority preferences and mitigates the
              threats of vote splitting and spoiler effects that can undermine
              elections run with traditional voting systems.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              The key idea of <em>stability</em> is that if a candidate A would
              win without another candidate B in the election, and a majority of
              voters prefer A to B, then A should still win when B is included
              in the election.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              The only exception to stability should be for tie-breaking: if
              there is another candidate C who has the same kind of claim to
              winning as A does&mdash;that is, C would win without a candidate D
              in the election, and a majority of voters prefer C to D&mdash;then
              it is legitimate to choose between A and C (and any other
              candidates with the same kind of claim to winning).
            </Paragraph>

            <Question>How does it work?</Question>
            <Paragraph>
              Voters rank the candidates. Then Stable Voting determines the
              winner of an election by looking at{" "}
              <em> head-to-head matches </em> between candidates:
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              If more voters rank candidate A above candidate B than rank B
              above A, then A <em> wins </em> their head-to-head match and B{" "}
              <em> loses </em> their head-to-head match.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              If one candidate{" "}
              <em>wins its matches against all other candidates</em>, this
              candidate&mdash;known as the{" "}

            <Question>
              What if there is no candidate who wins all head-to-head matches?
            </Question>

            <Paragraph>
              It is possible that every candidate loses a head-to-head match to
              some other candidate. For example, in an election with three
              candidates, A, B, and C, it may be that A wins head-to-head
              against B, B wins head-to-head against C, and C wins head-to-head
              against A, so each candidate has one loss. This is an example of a{" "}
              <em>majority cycle</em>.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              To deal with majority cycles, we look at the{" "}
              <em> margins of victory or loss </em> in head-to-head matches. The{" "}
              <em> margin of </em> A vs. B is the number of voters who rank A
              above B minus the number of voters who rank B above A. If the
              margin is positive, it is a margin of victory for A; if the margin
              is negative, it is a margin of loss for A.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              We resolve majority cycles as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <Box>
                    For each majority cycle, the match with the smallest margin
                    of victory in that cycle is discarded.{" "}
                  </Box>

                  <Box sx={{ paddingTop: "10px", paddingBottom: "10px" }}>
                    For example, if A wins against B by 1,000 votes, B wins
                    against C by 2,000 votes, and C wins against A by 3,000
                    votes, then Aâ€™s win against B is discarded.
                  </Box>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The wins in the remaining matches are considered{" "}
                  <em>defeats</em> of the losing candidates.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              There is always an undefeated candidate. If there is only one,
              that candidate wins the election.

            <Question>
              What if there is more than one undefeated candidate?
            </Question>

            <Paragraph>
              If there is more than one undefeated candidate, we break the tie
              as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  List all head-to-head matches of the form A vs. B, where A is
                  undefeated, in order from the largest to smallest margin of A
                  vs. B. Find the first match A vs. B in the list such that A is
                  a Stable Voting winner{" "}
                  <em> after B is removed from all ballots</em>; this A is the
                  Stable Voting winner for the original set of ballots.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              This rule guarantees that the only exceptions to stability occur
              when multiple candidates have a claim to winning based on
              stability, in which case the winner is the candidate with the
              strongest claim, as measured by the margin of A vs. B where A
              would win without B in the election.
